# Investment Philosophy

## Investing in the Future

At Draper Associates, our investment philosophy is built on a foundation of bold thinking, transformative technology, and unwavering support for visionary entrepreneurs.

### 1. **Think Big, Start Early**

### 4. **Global from Day One**
In an interconnected world, we help our companies think globally from inception. Our international network and experience enable rapid global expansion.

### 5. **Long-Term Value Creation**
We're patient capital. We understand that transformative companies take time to build and are committed to supporting our entrepreneurs through the entire journey.
